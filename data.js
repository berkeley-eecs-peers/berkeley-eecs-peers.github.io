I grew up in Florida from a really small high school in a really small community, then came out to Berkeley. Quite the change! In grad school, I've faced part-time jobs, internship hunts, switching projects, co-advising, teaching classes (large, small, undergrad, grad), imposter syndrome, long distance relationships, isolation, mental health challenges. Grad school (and life) can be hard and has all sorts of ups and downs, and I'm happy to talk to you about anything on your mind. I believe it's important to learn about yourself and find what works well for you."},

My research interests lie at the intersection of control and optimization theory with power systems and renewable energy incorporation in the grid. Current hobbies include sports, coffee, wine, food, dancing, and playing music."},

I grew up and did my undergrad in Florida (go gators!) and came out to Berkeley for grad school. I'm happy to chat about whatever's on your mind! I've faced big team research projects, individual work, research successes (and failures), college football, (abroad) internships canceled, exploration of multiple research directions, passing/failing prelim, GSI'ing a lab course, imposter syndrome, health challenges, work/life balance struggles and wins, burnout, bay area explorations and adventures, music, taking non-EECS classes for fun (entrepreneurship, Chinese language). I'm a big fan of biking, music (rock, EDM, etc), and getting outdoors"},

Work-wise, I can talk about navigating co-advisorship, applying to fellowships, being in a small lab, interfacing with LBL, time management techniques, managing stress, and prioritizing rest. Outside of work, I can talk about getting involved in campus orgs (e.g. GSA, Berkeley Science Review), finding housing and friends in grad school, maintaining a long-distance relationship and long-distance friendships, going out in SF and Oakland, moving from the East Coast, feelings of inadequacy + being hard on yourself, and finding activities that energize you. Above all though, I'm more than happy to talk about anything on your mind, or be a pair of ears to listen to you if that's what you need :)."},

My name is Orr (He/him), and I’m a final-year student at the Theory group, where I research topics topics in the intersection of proof systems and machine learning. My academic experience includes switching from my temp advisor, switching research areas, (not) switching permanent co-advisors, GSI’ing a graduate-level course while learning its material, applying for fellowships, volunteering at a CS summer camp in Jamaica, and lots more. On the non-academic side, we can talk about being an international student, co-operative housing, staying healthy in grad school, hobbies, or anything else that’s on your mind. Grad school has been a fun ride with plenty of bumps along the way. I’d love to share from my experience, and hear more about yours!"},

I'm Justin (he/him), and I've been a CS PhD student at Berkeley since 2020. My research interests lie at the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction, and, lately, I've been really excited to apply techniques from these fields to build better computational tooling for biologists. My main hobby is music composition—and just engaging with music more generally, especially video game music! Regarding work topics, I'm happy to chat about topics like maintaining a healthy work-life balance, struggling to find an exciting research direction, doing interdisciplinary research (including with collaborators outside of EECS), diving into new research areas mid-PhD, mentoring undergraduate / 5th-year MS researchers, helping set up a positive research group culture, studying for the prelim exams, and feeling anxious about things like taking the prelim exam / giving oral presentations / receiving paper reviews. Outside of work topics, I'm also happy to chat about topics like maintaining a long-distance relationship, finding housing in the Bay Area, learning how to cook / meal prep, and exploring new hobbies (and maintaining old ones!) in grad school. But these topics are by no means exhaustive, and I'd really love to chat with you about whatever is on your mind! :)"},

I’m particularly interested in decentralized systems with partial observability. Some academic things I have experience with include GSI-ing a lab course, being co-advised, taking a semester off for an internship and needing to apply for readmission into the program, withdrawing from classes, mentoring undergrads, outreach volunteering, imposter syndrome, questioning grad school, paper rejection (and acceptance!), and generally trying to find a work-life balance. I’ve found joy outside of the program singing with the campus choral program, going hiking in the area, seeing shows in SF, and drinking lots of wine in Napa. I’d be happy to talk about any of these and anything else that might be on your mind!"},

My name is Hellina (she/her), and I am a 3rd year PhD student in the EECS department. My research is in the intersection of NLP, HCI and ethics; I am particularity interested in building language technologies for low-resourced language (languages that do not have a lot of available data) speakers and understanding the impact of current AI systems as it relates to low-resourced language speakers. In my free time, I mostly talk with my family, read books, or make Ethiopian coffee. I am also really interested in languages: I am learning Arabic this year . I have also started learning how to play a musical instrument called Masinqo. I am on the EB for the Black Graduate Engineering and Science Students (BGESS) organisation and I focus on increasing access to research opportunities to Black undergrads at Berkeley and beyond. I am happy to chat about research related stuff, pivoting during your PhD, BGESS stuff, international student life and dealing with homesickness  , languages, finding and being a mentor, prelims, culture (and culture shock!!), and anything else related to my experience as a grad student."},

In terms of experience: I GSl'ed a (delightfully) nightmarish summer course, I took the HCl prelim (after a long torturous decision process), and I publicly transitioned (definitely still on going). I'm involved in the union and a couple affinity groups on campus. I love to chat, and am very open to emails or slacks (though please include \"popcorn\" in your intro so I know where you're coming from!). I'm still figuring out \"how to PhD,\" but with any luck my quals will be underway soon!"},
