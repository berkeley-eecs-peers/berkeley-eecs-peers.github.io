My research mission is to work with scientists to build programming systems *for* them and *with* them to empower them to write the code they need without having programming expertise. Outside of work, one of my main hobbies is music composition—and just engaging with music more generally, especially video game music! Regarding work topics, I'm happy to chat about topics like maintaining a healthy work-life balance, struggling to find an exciting research direction, doing interdisciplinary research (including with collaborators outside of EECS), diving into new research areas mid-PhD, mentoring undergraduate / 5th-year MS researchers, helping set up a positive research group culture, studying for the prelim exams, and feeling anxious about things like taking the prelim exam / giving oral presentations / receiving paper reviews. For outside of work topics, I'm also happy to chat about topics like maintaining a long-distance relationship, finding housing in the Bay Area, learning how to cook / meal prep, and exploring new hobbies (and maintaining old ones!) in grad school. But these topics are by no means exhaustive, and I'd really love to chat with you about whatever is on your mind! :-)"

        bio: "Hello! My name is Hellina (she/her), and I am a 3rd year PhD student in the EECS department. My research is in the intersection of NLP, HCI and ethics; I am particularity interested in building language technologies for low-resourced language (languages that do not have a lot of available data) speakers and understanding the impact of current AI systems as it relates to low-resourced language speakers. In my free time, I mostly talk with my family, read books, or make Ethiopian coffee. I am also really interested in languages: I am learning Arabic this year . I have also started learning how to play a musical instrument called Masinqo. I am on the EB for the Black Graduate Engineering and Science Students (BGESS) organisation and I focus on increasing access to research opportunities to Black undergrads at Berkeley and beyond. I am happy to chat about research related stuff, pivoting during your PhD, BGESS stuff, international student life and dealing with homesickness  , languages, finding and being a mentor, prelims, culture (and culture shock!!), and anything else related to my experience as a grad student."

I’m also involved in the union and a couple affinity groups on campus. I love to chat, and am very open to emails or slacks. I’m still figuring out “how to PhD,” but with any luck my quals will be underway soon!"

I’m happy to talk about working across departments or institutions, navigating interdisciplinary research, and figuring things out along the way. Through my time here so far, I’ve experienced some struggles balancing health and work, a bit of imposter syndrome, and finding new communities in Berkeley to connect with. Outside of research, I like playing sports (especially tennis and basketball) with friends, sketching, and reading. During undergrad I was also very active in the startup/VC community, co-founded a company myself, and worked a bit in venture even leading up to starting grad school. I’m happy to chat with you about these topics or anything else that you’ve been experiencing as a grad student!"

In the rest of my life, I like to climb, pet my cat, bake and eat baked goods, write haikus, and explore new kinds of arts and crafts. I really enjoy talking to other grad students about grad school, because I genuinely find it to be a great metaphor for life. I would be happy to talk about topics like the existential stresses of grad school (and life), navigating an unstructured/hands-off advisor environment, finding friends and queer (and not) community off campus, teaching as a GSI and over the summer as an instructor, adopting a diabetic cat, and really whatever else might be on your mind. Grad school and life are hard, so let’s not try to do it alone."
